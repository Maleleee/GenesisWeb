* User-Friendly Interface: Responsive and intuitive design for easy navigation.
* Real-Time Monitoring: Tracks user activity in real-time.
* User Feedback: Allows users to report suspicious activities.
* Admin Dashboard: Provides insights into detected anomalies.

# Technologies Used

* Back-End: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login, Flask-Mail, Flask-SocketIO
* Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Database: SQLite
* Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
* Version Control: Git
